### Project Title
 Investigate a dataset

### No-show medical appointments in Brazil
This dataset gives information about 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The analysis is focused on finding trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments.
* ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
* ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
* ‘No_show’ it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
The goad is to investigate the above dataset to answer different queries
